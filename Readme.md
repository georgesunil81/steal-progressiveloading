To run the app, clone the project, then
 
(1) npm install
(2) npm run build

This is a simple app that is supposed to show an alert to user that he/she is eligible to make a purchase after the credit and inventory are checked. My expectation is to see the appcontroller.js, credit.js and inventory.js being loaded from the dist folder in production, but it doesn't as seen from the Network tab in Chrome dev tools. Could you help troubleshoot?
